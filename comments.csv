TO Jeff Klann,
We are nearly complete occur within th on an expanded i2b2 metadata for dugs which has a (nearly) complete history of RXNORM and NDC.  I want to deploy your medication modifiers but we are going to need to support some additional elements to support all of our use cases.  In particular, your modifiers identify RX_BASIS of dispensing and prescribing.  I suggest we need to cover administration events as well.  Dispense events may be from a pharmacy external to the institution, or occur within the inpatient (hospital) pharmacy for patients in-house.  Prescriptions are generally descriptive of orders to the external pharmacies but I notice that you add a subtype which appears to be the in-clinic order to the nurse for administration.  

I assume that you link the order detail of frequency, days supply, quantity and refills to the RX_basis fact via the instance_num? 

I can suggest extensions to your modifier set for the additional use cases but I need your direction as to how we can cover these other use cases not necessarily required for CDMV3.

I think we need to build a history file of our own from Oliviers dump to supplement for future loads:
RXCUI|STR|IN|current|
351399|Prednisone 5mg oral tablet (Prednicot)(052006_112016)|8640||….
That we will process with each build to add the historical concepts.
If the concept has a current equivalent, we should create a folder for SBD/SCD/BPCK/GPCKs and add the current and historical concepts as children.

I want to eliminate ATC from the build we distribute and include all RXNORM in the ATC hierarchy that are not in the AV hierarchy.  I have attached a worksheet with those codes and their appearance in ATC.  We should build records for them linking to their ingredient and tie them into the VA hierarchy where the RXNORM for the ingredient exists.  All others should be tied to the N000029593 MISCELLANEOUS AGENTS section of the VA hierarchy so that the VA scheme will have all drugs

Jay will create a new graph database with the current SNOMED CT codes and relationships.  (Deleted codes will not be present in his source files).

Assuming that we have all HL7 synoptic report messages stored in Mirth, we will be able to repopulate the new graphDB via reprocessing the messages.  (Can Philconfirm that we have all the HL7 messages stored back to the first one?  I think we had Milissa retransmit when you started working on this grant.)

We will need to have Phil write a message transform script that will transform the HL7 messages to replace SNOMED CT codes no longer present with their replaced codes.  The list is small (<100 codes)

Once the transform script is validated, we can reprocess the stored hl7 messages and import into the graphDB using the transform and rest API.

We can leave the transform process in place for current Copath messages, too.  This will allow us some flexibility in Copath coding change timing.  Once the Copath coding (SNOMED CT) changes are moved to production Copath, the transform process will no longer be needed and can be removed.  However, it will not hurt to have it in place.

We will then extract paraffin specimen data elements from the current graphDB and import into the new graphDB.  These items are not affected by any changes in the SNOMED CT numbering."

#1. TRAC backup

For our TRAC instances, which exist on NECARES DEV, we need to backup the folder structure:

    /sno/trac

I suggest we create a backup folder to store this:

  /sno/backup

We would create a cron job, to run at 2:05 am (or some such), which performs this backup.

I have existing bash and python scripts which can be modified to make this work.
I will work with Yesh on that so that he understands how those scripts work.

#2. GITLAB backup

Here is some information on performing a backup of the GITLAB repositories.

I believe that we do not need to send anything further related to the DIAGNOSIS metadata to Harvard, per the following:

SCHILS METADATA already includes modifier metadata for the condition status values of Active, Resolved and Inactive.  They use the following MODIFIER_CD values to indicate this:

{{{
CONDITION_STATUS:AC -- Active
CONDITION_STATUS:IN -- Inactive
CONDITION_STATUS:RS -- Resolved
}}}

This can be found by the following query of the SCILHS metadata:
{{{
select * from SCILHS_METADATA where m_applied_path<>'@' and M_APPLIED_PATH like '\PCORI\DIAGNOSIS\%' and c_basecode like 'CONDITION_STATUS%'
}}}

These correspond to the metadata codes that we had defined for Active, Resolved and Deleted:
{{{
DX|PROB:ACTIVE
DX|PROB:DELETED
DX|PROB:RESOLVED
}}}

I believe that they do not need these definitions, as they already have modifier metadata for these semantics.  The difference from theirs and ours is the specific MODIFIER_CD values which are used when publishing the Problem List facts.

We may want to change our codes match theirs in our i2b2 ETL for PROBLEM LIST and in our PROBLEM LIST metadata.

It was determined that there should be 3 modifier metadata items related to SNOMED CT diagnoses -- for ACTIVE, RESOLVED and DELETED.  These were not delivered to Jeff Klann and Sean Murphy on July 2 when the DIAGNOSIS metadata was sent to them.

Specifically, this is for MODIFIER_CD values in the facts of
{{{
DX|PROB:ACTIVE
DX|PROB:DELETED
DX|PROB:RESOLVED
}}}

These need to be applied to the following paths in SCHILS DIAGNOSIS

{{{
\PCORI\DIAGNOSIS\SM\%
}}}

This will be sent to Harvard this week.

9,10:37:13-05:00,jpedersen,_comment1,"JGP investigation (concludes that nothing additional needs to be sent for DIAGNOSIS)

I believe that we do not need to send anything further related to the DIAGNOSIS metadata to Harvard, per the following:

SCHILS METADATA already includes modifier metadata for the condition status values of Active, Resolved and Inactive.  They use the following MODIFIER_CD values to indicate this:

{{{
CONDITION_STATUS:AC
CONDITION_STATUS:IN
CONDITION_STATUS:RS
}}}

This can be found by the following query of the SCILHS metadata:
{{{
select * from SCILHS_METADATA where m_applied_path<>'@' and M_APPLIED_PATH like '\PCORI\DIAGNOSIS\%' and c_basecode like 'CONDITION_STATUS%'
}}}

These correspond to the metadata codes that we had defined for Active, Resolved and Deleted:
{{{
DX|PROB:ACTIVE
DX|PROB:DELETED
DX|PROB:RESOLVED
}}}

I believe that they do not need these definitions, as they already have modifier metadata for these semantics.  The difference from theirs and ours is the specific MODIFIER_CD values which are used when publishing the Problem List facts.

We may want to change our codes match theirs in our i2b2 ETL for PROBLEM LIST and in our PROBLEM LIST metadata.

I wanted to finish the changes requested by Geoff and company, but after making the necessary changes was not finding any results, and uncovered a few issues.
 
NECARES was never updated to add any deidentified fields when adding data
Mirth processing for loading synoptic reports does create patients, cases, and links to case parts, but does nothing with deidentified data
When you created deidentified fields in the existing product, ParaffinSpecimen, that contains case, patient, and case part type, was not deidentified
 
NECARES will create ParaffinSpecimen, but makes no attempt to link the tissue specimen with a patient record, by design, as typically patient information is not known. I also don’t remember any discussion about linking the paraffin specimen to a patient record, but it seems to me we should not be putting patient and case information in ParaffinSpecimen, and if necessary creating a patient record and link the patient record to the ParaffinSpecimen..
 
I found the nodes (NEC_DeidSequence) you created to keep track of the next sequence number, so I will need to update NECARES, but we do need to decide if NECARES should create patient records. I hate to have information in multiple locations.
 
Let me know your thoughts."

A problem was discovered with the Diagnosis (SNOMED) metadata previously sent to Jeff Klann. 
This was determined on Friday, June 30.
A fix for the issue was created two days later on Sunday, and sent to Jeff Klann on the same day (Sunday July 2). This metadata is based on using the concept_dimension, which is more in keeping with the rest of the SCILHS metadata.
NOTE: The results of several queries involving all 3 SNOMED hierarchies relating to diagnosis (findings, events, situations) were compared to the results of a transitive-closure based version of the same information. The results matched in all tested cases.

9,09:25:40-06:00,campbell,comment,40,"Hi Jim,

I spent a chunk of time examining the list of 19,462 ""Never Active"" orderable drugs
from the comprehensive history file from the NLM (Nov 1, 2017).  I can tie 18,813
of them to ingredients by parsing the names.  I cant do that for 649 of them.
Of the 90 codes we were missing, 79 belong in the set of 18,813 which can be tied
to ingredients.  10 belong to the set of 649 that cant be tied to an ingredient.

One code, 853442, was a different code type altogether -- type OCD
(code 853442, Testotop TTS 15mg transdermal patch).  That code has 24 occurrences in our fact table.

I did not dig any further into NDC codes yet.

DETAILS

Using the parsing heuristic suggested by Olivier, I was able to tie 18,813
of these to one or more ingredients.  That is, by parsing the drug name to
extract its ingredient ... and then performing an exact match against
the known ingredient names.

That means that 649 could not be tied to ingredients using the heuristic that I coded,
extending what Olivier suggested somewhat.

Consider the 90 RXNORM codes from our fact table which did not map to our metadata.

Of these:
  79 are in the set of 18,813 'never active' drugs that I could tie to a known ingredient
  10 are in the set of 649 which I could not tie to an ingredient
   1 was not an orderable drug at all, by our rule of SCD,SBD,GPCK,BPCK, it was of type 'OCD', code 853442

The OCD codes are another can of worms.

This particular code, in the history file, has the following definition:

853442 Never Active
Testotop TTS 15mg transdermal patch OCD
72009 72009

So ... we have to discuss, how to deal with these codes ... or if we are going to deal with them.

I can incorporate the 18,813 into our existing structure ... by ingredient.  I can't do that for the 649.

We could create a 'Never Active' section in the metadata to accomodate them.
"
9,09:50:22-06:00,campbell,comment,41,"I propose for resolution:
1) All 'never active' codes we include in metadata should be flagged as such, like you have done for 'retired'.  Dates of first reference should be included if we can get them.
2) We should focus on complete metadata for all codes we have in our database.  Pass me the 11 codes (10 SBD/SCD and one OCD) that could not be mapped to an ingredient and I will do that by hand with references back to you for our history file.
3) The large number of 'never active' codes that you mapped to ingredient should be handed to me for brief quality check and then we should include them in our metadata as history since other sites may have employed them.  All others that could not be parsed and mapped should be placed in a bucket in the 'ingredient' schema under 'Undocumented ingredient' so that we can verify their status if they come up in future queries.
4) The 'Testotop' brand of OCD should be mapped to RXCUI 10379 as ingredient and placed in our metadata as soon as we know what an 'OCD' might be.

FOREACH (o in CASE when pseq is not null then [pseq] else [] | SET o.caseId = 'aModifiedValue')

Can this be done with EXISTS?

There apparently is a APOC method, APOC.do.when() with if-then functionality.  Can we rely on the APOC routines to always exist and maintain their syntax and semantics?

Specific question -- foreign key values.

Are foreign key values in a node typically not used if there is an edge to the foreign node?  That is if there were a component node which had an edge to a part node, is the partId typically stored with the component node or just the edge?

EGFR mAb: panitumumab, cetuximab. Zalutumumab (not available in the US outside of a clinical trial).

BRAF inhibitors: vemurafenib, sorafenib, and dabrafenib. Sorafenib is not a BRAF inhibitor.

Others: Regorafenib (Multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor; does not need molecular testing).

Immunotherapy: Pembrolizumab, nivolumab (for MSI-H patients).

 

Data dictionary: I would also collect subsequent therapy; dates of subsequent therapy; response to targeted therapy.

45,13:08:12-06:00,campbell,comment,6,"Nick,
I enclose spreadsheets with records from Clarity EAF (facility) and DEP (department) tables.  I pulled addresses into a separate worksheet expecting that we can use the geocoding software from Jay and Bret to get physical locations…we may have to do some work with Nebraska Medicine zip codes.  We  should discuss with Scott and Jim M if we want to extend to include individual bed location…I think probably so and we will use this data to restructure our bed history.
 
My notion is that each node in the ontology would have defining elements of:
-geocoded location (physical planetary address)
-building identifier (co-location identifier for physical structures)
-service area-revenue center/department id/bed identifier (enterprise management designation)
(Trevor – do we want to include service personnel units?  Ie, indicator for units such as all beds that are served by common nursing personnel? This would primarily be department, but large units such as 5W might have two nursing staff pools)
 
This would allow us to query antibiogram data by specimens obtained from patients by geographic domain, hospital unit or bed or originating from the same physical facility.
Jim"

Trevor vanSchoeneveld responded:
To answer your question yes would like to have locations able to be pooled into single unit (think that is what you are asking).  For example 3rd floor ICU is actually 3 different locations per our lab but those locations are rather arbitrary and so would only use them as pooled location.  Verses 5th floor Clarkson where one portion of that floor is ICU step down, but rest is a believe med surg and there would want to separate as very different patients and nursing pools.  Overall your plan seems good.  The trick is always keeping up with changing hospital unit designations.  We had a number of new units created/renamed just in the last 4 months.
