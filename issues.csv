This was done because the creation of the worksheet codes was still in-progress.

This should no longer be allowed, as the worksheet codes have been coded and are installed into the graph database.

This library is not maintained by NEO4J.

  http://py2neo.org/v3/

As of NEO4J 3.0, the NEO4J team itself has created and supports a python library for access NEO4J graphs known as ""neo4j-python-driver"".  This is what they reference at the official site (they previously referenced ""py2neo"", among other libraries).

  http://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/
  https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver

The library is called ""The Official Neo4j Driver for Python supports Neo4j 3.0 and above and Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6."".

It likely makes sense to modify our code to use ""The Official Neo4j Driver for Python"" instead of py2neo.  It will surely enjoy better support as NEO4J itself is maintaining it.

34,"Graph creation software - error detection for NEO4J issues, python 3 support","The code that creates the SNOMED CT core can be improved by the following

#1. Validate that the interface to NEO4J is working,
    and specifically that LOAD CSV commands will work.

Currently, if there is a NEO4J issue ... it is not determined until a lot of work has already been done (creation of CSV files and CYPHER files).

It would be better to ensure that NEO4J access is working up-front, rather than generate an error after a significant amount of time.

#2. Support python version 3 (currently only supports python version 2.7)

The effort for these items is low to medium, less than a day for the first and perhaps two days for the second.

#3. Ensure that all errors that occur are logged in build.log

If the LOAD CSV command fails, the reason for the failure needs to be logged in build.log so a user can use that to inform them of the exact problem that is occurring.

36,Database anomaly -- linkage of CasePart to Case missing from some CasePart nodes,"BOTTOM LINE

We currently have 93 {{{CasePart}}} nodes in production which do not link directly to their associated {{{Case}}} node.

The cause behind this needs to be identified.

The symptom can be temporarily dealt with by adding a HAS_CASE_PART edge from the associated Case node to the CasePart node which is missing the edge.  But this would not prevent new instances of the problem from occurring.

DETAILS

CasePart SC17-1667-B is an example case which appears to be missing an edge to its associated Case node SC17-1667.  CYPHER:

{{{
match (cp:CasePart {casePartId: 'SC17-1667-B'}), (c:Case {caseId: 'SC17-1667'}) return c,cp

38,Update NEO4J to 3.2.2 in PROD and TEST from 3.0.7,"We currently have NEO4J 3.2.2 in NECARES DEV, but 3.0.7 in NECARES PROD and TEST.

NEO4J 3.2.2 is the current NEO4J software with reportedly significant improvements in query performance.

This ticket documents the procedure for installing NEO4J 3.2.2, with a fallback procedure of restoring NEO4J 3.0.7 if needed.

--------- INSTALLATION PROCEDURE  -----------------

This would have to be done off-hours, but is a matter of the following:
{{{
  #1. install NEO4J 3.2.2 on the machine
         (creating /opt/neo4j-community-3.2.2)
  #2. configure NEO4J appropriately (conf/neo4j.conf file will need changes)
        (a) /opt/neo4j-community-3.2.2/conf/neo4j.conf
            Use configuration options similar to what is on DEV which is running 3.2.2.
  #3. update the system startup to start version 3.2 instead of 3.0.7
        (a) file /sno/scripts/start_neo4j.bash
        (b) change
              /opt/neo4j-community-3.0.7/bin/neo4j start 
            to
              /opt/neo4j-community-3.2.2/bin/neo4j start 
  #4. restart system, which
        (a) tests the startup of NEO4j 3.2.2
        (b) causes the database format to upgrade to 3.2.2 format
}}}

------------ FALLBACK (BACKOUT PROCEDURE) --------------------

If there is an issue, the NEO4J 3.0.7 software will still exist on the machine.
We could recover by restoring the backup and re-establishing NEO4J 3.0.7 as the
software to start on system startup.
{{{
  #1. shut down NEO4J
  #2. restore the NEO4J database from 2:00 am backup
         the backup is in /sno/backup/NECARES_<YYYYMMDD>.tar.gz
         which needs to be restored to /sno/neo/databases/necares_sno20170331
  #3. modify the /sno/scripts/start_neo4j.bash to start NEO4J 3.0.7 (system startup)
         /opt/neo4j-community-3.0.7/bin/neo4j start
  #4. restart NEO4J
         -- will start neo4j 3.0.7 using the restored database in 3.0.7 format

THere was one case that appeared to be added (by Mirth) after I distributed the de-identifiers.  The associated nodes for that case are missing de-identifiers.  This makes sense to me as we haven't updated the automated processing (mirth) to add the de-identifiers in PROD.

Additionally ...

The only other issue I saw was for ParaffinSpecimen nodes,
for which you can not always find Case nodes or Patient nodes.

Possible fix for ParaffinSpecimen case:

We could potentially create 'sparse' Patient and Case nodes
for these cases -- with just the key fields (eg. patientId, caseId).  This is what we previously discussed doing.
